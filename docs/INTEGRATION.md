# Integration with Stock Features

In all supported cars:
* Stock Lane Keep Assist (LKA) and stock ALC are replaced by catpilot ALC, which only functions when catpilot is engaged by the user.
* Stock LDW is replaced by catpilot LDW.

Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in [supported cars](CARS.md)):
* Stock ACC is replaced by catpilot ACC.
* catpilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.

catpilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.
